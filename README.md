**Tell us what your idea is.**

1. **VoiceTuner** provides a **customized** and effective way to learn a **target accent** or any **human voice,** let it be a foreign language or a speech with heavy accent you want to imitate in your standup show. 

   

   How does it work: 

   

   1. It will analyzes a target audio, tag individual phoneme in the audio to a [**IPA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) symbol, then divide it into small practice segments by **recognizing the natural gap in the audio**. The IPA symbols serves as a visual indicator of your score. ![New Mockup 2](/Users/aislinnliao/Desktop/1/New Mockup 2.png)

   2. While the user uses the microphone on the phone to start mimicking, VoiceTuner instantly **evaluates** the voice and gives a green/red feedback comparing to the original.

   3. The users can choose to adjust themselves and repeat it as many times as they want, then click on the marked symbols to see the **guides** on how to adjust the vocal position, and practice this sound **alone**.![New Mockup 2 copy 2](/Users/aislinnliao/Desktop/1/New Mockup 2 copy 2.png)

      

      

   4.  The app also provides a **customized** practice by compose a unique ‘word’ for users: a combination of a consonant sound + a vowel sound which is also a combination of **the sound to learn+ a sound you’ve already mastered**. ![New Mockup 2 copy 3](/Users/aislinnliao/Desktop/1/New Mockup 2 copy 3.png)

   5. If this is for your long-term learning, you can build a specific project for it. The app will analysis the **learning progress** you have and check if a pronunciation has been tackled in the progress. You can from a heat map a simple data analysis of your progress.![New Mockup 2 copy 4](/Users/aislinnliao/Desktop/1/New Mockup 2 copy 4.png)

Hi, my name is [Aislinn Liao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aislinn-liao-42556b90/) . I'm a technology enthusiast, IT product manager, language lover and a world traveler. I love using technology ideas to solve problems and help to tranform a conventional process in life or at work. I'm the Co-Founder and Content Lead of [**Lingwave**](https://www.lingwave.com/) , and also have 3 years experience managing various products. Respct to this product idea, I've been deep traveling to more than 10 countries in the world and picking up local languages and accents along with the [trip](https://www.instagram.com/aislinnliao/?hl=es-la). And there're always this tiny little need whereever I go to pick up just one or two sentences or accent to bring the conversation to life or build a rapid rapport with the encounters. 

In my team, there're talented developers of Android and IoT as well as UI/UX designers.
